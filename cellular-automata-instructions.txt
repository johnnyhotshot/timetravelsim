Each tile looks at all 8 of its neighbors, and does the following processes in order:

[ Water ]
1. If there are 4 or more neighboring tiles with a larger water amount, take 10% of their water and add it to the tile (Capped at 1.0 water for the tile)
2. If there are less than 4 but more than 1 adjacent water tiles, take 15% from the highest water tile out of the adjacent tiles and the current tile, add 10% to the lowest water out of those, and add 5% to the second lowest water one.

[ Plants ]
1. If the amount of water on the the tile is greater than twice the plant value, divide the plant value in half
2. 1/3 random chance to increase the plant amount of the tile by 0.1% of the largest adjacent water tile
3. 1/5 random chance to increase the plant amount of the tile by 0.05% of the largest adjacent plant tile

[ Animals ]
1. If the amount of water on the the tile is greater than twice the animal value, divide the animal value in half
2. 1/4 random chance to increase the plant amount of the tile by 0.1% of the largest adjacent plant tile (removing 1% of the plant tile)
3. 1/5 random chance to increase the plant amount of the tile by 0.05% of the largest adjacent animal tile

[ Humans ]
1. If the amount of water on the tile is greater than 2.5 times the human value, multiply the human value by 2/3
2. 1/5 random chance to increase the human amount of the tile by 0.1% of the largest adjacent animal time (removing 1% of the animal tile)
3. 1/10 random chance to increast the human amount of the tile by 0.08% of the largest adjacent plant tile (Removing 1% of the plant tile)
4. 1/5 random chance to increase the plant amount of the tile by 0.05% of the largest adjacent human tile

[ Urbanization ]
1. Only increases when human value is over 0.5 (0.25 if there are no adjacent urbanization titles)
2. If the amount of water in the tile is greater than twice the urbanization, divide the urbanization by 2
3. 1/10 random chance to increase by tech value times human value
4. 1/10 random chance to increase by 0.1% of the highest nearby urbanization tile
5. Capped by 1.25x the human value

[ Technology Level ]
1. 1/10 chance to increase by 5% the urbanization level
. Capped at 1.5x the urbanization and 1.0, whichever is lower
